        Introduction of core algorithmic techniques and proof strategies that underlie the best known provable
        guarantees for minimizing high dimensional convex functions. Focus on broad canonical optimization problems and survey
        results for efficiently solving them, ultimately providing the theoretical foundation for further study in optimization.
        In particular, focus will be on first-order methods for both smooth and non-smooth convex function minimization as well
        as methods for structured convex function minimization, discussing algorithms such as gradient descent, accelerated
        gradient descent, mirror descent, Newton's method, interior point methods, and more.

    <h1> Leadership and Committees </h1>
    <h2> <a href="https://hkn.mit.edu/">HKN (Eta Kappa Nu, EECS Honor Society)</a> </h2>
    <p>
      Fall 2015 - Spring 2018
    </p>
    <p>
      Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) is the national honor society for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
      with chapters across the world. Joining as a junior, I ranked within the top quartile of
      EECS majors in my year. As a part of HKN, I tutored students in EECS classes and ran workshops
      on soldering and fabrication skills.
    </p>
    <h2> USAGE (Undergraduate Student Advisory Group in EECS)
    <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/2015-2015-USAGE">[1]</a>
    <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/node/6866">[2]</a> </h2>
    <p>
      Fall 2015 - Spring 2017
    </p>
    <p>
      The Undergraduate Student Advisory Group in EECS (USAGE) helps the department
      grow by providing feedback about their experiences. USAGE members meet regularly
      with the EECS Department Head, Undergraduate Officer, and Undergraduate
      Administrator. Additionally, they meet with other members of the department
      leadership, including associate department heads and the 2015 EECS Visiting Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, during my time, we worked on the development of a new curriculum,
      especially the electrical engineering curriculum. We also evaluated the student
      experiences in the department, studied student workload, and
      advised on the direction of the 6-A Masters of Engineering Thesis Progam.

    <h2> <a href="http://voltage.scripts.mit.edu/voltage/index.html">
      Voltage (MIT IEEE/ACM's Electrical Engineering Subcommittee)</a></h2>
    <p>
      Fall 2014 - Spring 2016
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltage is the electrical engineering subcommittee of MIT's IEEE/ACM chapter.
      We are a group of undergraduates working to create a stronger, more cohesive MIT
      undergraduate EE community by organizing events that allow students, faculty, alumni,
      and industry to interact. We aim to make being 6-1 more than a major, but a community.
      Some events we have held in the past are the Undergraduate EE Expo, Research Expo,
      Alumni Dinner, Faculty and Student Dinner, and study breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, I spearheaded the creation of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nhbv08o34qahRSTc-GQv7CM8_mTN-4NWZEyNmfIeNww/edit">
      EE Field Guide</a>, a guide to different focus areas within electrical engineering,
      including suggested course pathways, research groups at MIT, and relevant industries
      for each discipline.

    <h2> MIT Marching Band </h2>
    <p>
      President, Spring 2015 - Fall 2015 and Spring 2017 - Fall 2017
    </p>
    <p>
      Secretary, Spring 2014 - Fall 2014 and Spring 2016 - Fall 2016
    </p>
    <p>
      As president, I organized all band events and handled communications
      between the band and external parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      As secretary, I reserved weekly rehearsal rooms, sent rehearsal reminders,
      kept attendance, and handled interactions between the band and MIT.
