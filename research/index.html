    <h1> Projects </h1>
    <p>
      All projects in this section are the final projects from graduate-level classes I've taken.
      I have been particularly interested in probabilistic modeling, inference, and machine learning.

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/j-s-hensley/EE-376a-Rumor-Spreading">Rumor Spreading Model</a></h2>
    <p>
      Author: Sarah Hensley
    </p>
    <p>
      This project builds a Barabasi-Albert scale free network to represent a social network,
      and initializes one "person" with a "fact". Over a period of time steps, this fact
      gets spread to everyone else, with some chance to mutate into a "rumor". The model used
      for spreading and mutating rumors relies on the entropy within each person's memory.
      This project investigates different parameters and initialization configurations, and
      visualizes them through gifs.

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/j-s-hensley/6.437-Deciphering">Deciphering with Metropolis Hastings</a></h2>
    <p>
      Author: Sarah Hensley
    </p>
    <p>
      This project deciphers text that has been encrypted with a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">simple substitution
      cipher</a>, which maps each character in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ." to
      another character. It does this by modeling text as a Markov chain, in which
      each character has some probability of following the previous character.
      It then uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a Markov chain
      Monte Carlo method, to repeatedly generate possible ciphers until it finds
      one that gives a deciphered piece of text with a high likelihood - typically
      the original input text!

    <h2><a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/119844">Characterization of
      monitoring alarms in a community hospital intensive care unit</a></h2>
    <p>
      Author: Sarah Hensley
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: Because the vast majority of monitoring alarms in the adult intensive care unit
       (ICU) do not require intervention, care providers are slow to respond to all alarms,
       endangering patients. We collect, characterize, and analyze alarms, alarm annotations
       provided by clinical staff while responding to alarms, and physiological data from a
       community hospital ICU. In order to suggest opportunities for suppressing irrelevant alarms,
       we examine monitoring device coverage across patients and analyze the alarms observed by device,
       priority, and type. On average, we observe 196.3 alarms per patient-day, for a total of 23,057
       alarms. From these, the electrocardiogram and pulse plethysmogram produce 86.1% of all alarms.
       The lowest priority alarms represent 81.1% of all alarms, while the highest priority alarms
       compose just 5.5% of the total. While the rate of annotations is low, also just 5.5% of possible
       alarms, it is comparable to the rate of care provider interactions with alarms, as measured
       by alarm silencing, at 9.6%. Using these annotations, we find -- surprisingly -- that the
       annotated nuisance threshold-violation alarms tend to have higher excursions than actionable
       and advisory alarms, offering a statistic for separation. When focusing on threshold-crossing
       alarms, we find that 22.5% of Heart Rate Low alarms may actually indicate device error. Among
       ST segment alarms, 44.4% occur simultaneously with at least one other ST segment alarm,
       producing redundant alarms. Addressing these issues represent strategies for reducing excessive
       alarms in this community hospital cohort of ICU patients.

    <h2><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7370930">Noncontact High-Torque Magnetic Coupler for Superconducting Rotating Machines</a></h2>
    <p>
      Authors: Philip C. Michael; Sarah Hensley; Christopher Galea; Edward Chen; Haran Karmaker; Leslie Bromberg
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: We present the design of a noncontact high-torque magnetic coupler in the context of
      a high-speed (> 3600 r/min) fully superconducting rotating electric machine. The magnetic coupler
      is an essential component for machines where both stator and rotor are enclosed within a common
      cryostat. The magnetic coupler eliminates the need for rotating shaft vacuum seals, which would
      otherwise be needed if a conventional torque tube were used. The rotor is cooled by natural convection
      from the stator, similarly eliminating the need for the rotating cryogen transfer coupling used for
      conventional superconducting rotors. The magnetic coupler satisfies the need to transmit torque from
      the prime mover to the generator across a stationary cryostat boundary. We rely to an array of multiple
      radially spaced stages to limit axial extent and improve the torque rating of the design. We demonstrate
      that, while it is feasible to transmit several kilonewton meter of torque through a magnetic coupler for
      medium-size machines (> 10 MW), the magnetic coupler is nearly as complex as the rest of the machine.
      This option should be considered if known reliability issues with high-speed rotating vacuum seals and
      cryogen transfer couplings cannot be resolved.

    <h2>Bedside Annotation Acquisition for Reduction of Nuisance Alarms</h2>
    <p>
      Presented at the Medical Electronic Device Realization Center Workshop and at EECS Masterworks
    </p>
    <p>
      Authors: Sarah Hensley; Minoru Matsushima; Thomas Heldt
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: The vast majority of alarms from bedside monitoring systems in intensive care units do not require intervention
      from care providers. As a result, care providers are slow to respond or ignore alarms altogether, endangering
      patients with time-sensitive need for intervention. To prevent this, it is important to understand which types of
      alarms are excessively non-actionable. This research seeks to characterize alarms from the ICU of a local community
      hospital. Unlike previous studies, we developed a system for care providers to annotate alarms by actions taken.
      Most monitor alarm studies have been conducted at academic hospitals, so collecting alarms from a community
      hospital offers insights that maybe be more representative of most hospitals.

    <h2>Balance and Force Control with NASAâ€™s Humanoid: Valkyrie</h2>
    <p>
      Presented at EECSCon and to the EECS Visiting Committee
    </p>
    <p>
      Authors: Sarah Hensley; Michael Posa; Russ Tedrake
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: Valkyrie is a humanoid robot designed to work in environments designed for humans, so it
      needs manual dexterity comparable to that of a human. The current controller operating on the arm of
      Valkyrie restricts the flow of sensor data between actuators in the arm, impairing performance. We
      examine three different information restriction policies to evaluate the performance each attains.
      We designed controllers that enforce these policies and implemented them on a simulation of the arm.
      Our results show that the controller with the least restrictive information sharing policy significantly
      improves performance of the arm over the other controllers.
