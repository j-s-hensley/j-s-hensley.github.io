    <h2><a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/119844">Characterization of
      monitoring alarms in a community hospital intensive care unit</a></h2>
    <p>

      Abstract: Because the vast majority of monitoring alarms in the adult intensive care unit (ICU) do not require intervention, care providers are slow to respond to all alarms, endangering patients. We collect, characterize, and analyze alarms, alarm annotations provided by clinical staff while responding to alarms, and physiological data from a community hospital ICU. In order to suggest opportunities for suppressing irrelevant alarms, we examine monitoring device coverage across patients and analyze the alarms observed by device, priority, and type. On average, we observe 196.3 alarms per patient-day, for a total of 23,057 alarms. From these, the electrocardiogram and pulse plethysmogram produce 86.1% of all alarms. The lowest priority alarms represent 81.1% of all alarms, while the highest priority alarms compose just 5.5% of the total. While the rate of annotations is low, also just 5.5% of possible alarms, it is comparable to the rate of care provider interactions with alarms, as measured by alarm silencing, at 9.6%. Using these annotations, we find -- surprisingly -- that the annotated nuisance threshold-violation alarms tend to have higher excursions than actionable and advisory alarms, offering a statistic for separation. When focusing on threshold-crossing alarms, we find that 22.5% of Heart Rate Low alarms may actually indicate device error. Among ST segment alarms, 44.4% occur simultaneously with at least one other ST segment alarm, producing redundant alarms. Addressing these issues represent strategies for reducing excessive alarms in this community hospital cohort of ICU patients.

      Abstract: We present the design of a noncontact high-torque magnetic coupler in the context of a high-speed (> 3600 r/min) fully superconducting rotating electric machine. The magnetic coupler is an essential component for machines where both stator and rotor are enclosed within a common cryostat. The magnetic coupler eliminates the need for rotating shaft vacuum seals, which would otherwise be needed if a conventional torque tube were used. The rotor is cooled by natural convection from the stator, similarly eliminating the need for the rotating cryogen transfer coupling used for conventional superconducting rotors. The magnetic coupler satisfies the need to transmit torque from the prime mover to the generator across a stationary cryostat boundary. We rely to an array of multiple radially spaced stages to limit axial extent and improve the torque rating of the design. We demonstrate that, while it is feasible to transmit several kilonewton meter of torque through a magnetic coupler for medium-size machines (> 10 MW), the magnetic coupler is nearly as complex as the rest of the machine. This option should be considered if known reliability issues with high-speed rotating vacuum seals and cryogen transfer couplings cannot be resolved.

    <h2>Bedside Annotation Acquisition for Reduction of Nuisance Alarms</h2>

      Abstract: The vast majority of alarms from bedside monitoring systems in intensive care units do not require intervention
      from care providers. As a result, care providers are slow to respond or ignore alarms altogether, endangering
      patients with time-sensitive need for intervention. To prevent this, it is important to understand which types of
      alarms are excessively non-actionable. This research seeks to characterize alarms from the ICU of a local community hospital. Unlike previous studies,
      we developed a system for care providers to annotate alarms by actions taken. Most monitor alarm studies have
      been conducted at academic hospitals, so collecting alarms from a community hospital offers insights that
      maybe be more representative of most hospitals.
